                <p>
                  I've volunteered with The Houston Food Bank on multiple occasions, including the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.  The Houston Food Bank is a non-profit organization that plays
                  a crucial role in fighting hunger and food insecurity in the greater Houston area.  It serves as a central hub for collecting, storing, and
                  distributing food and other essential resources to a network of local food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and other community organizations.
                  The Houston Food Bank's mission is to alleviate hunger by providing food to those in need while also addressing the root causes of hunger and food insecurity through advocacy and community initiatives.

                <h2>Second Mile Mission</h2>
                <p>
                  With my church, I've regularly participate in volunteer work at Second Mile Mission.  Second Mile Mission is a faith-based
                  non-profit organization dedicated to serving and supporting individuals and communities in need. They often focus on helping 
                  underserved and disadvantaged groups by providing essential goods and services such as food assistance, shelter, education, and
                  many other resources.  Second Mile Mission believes in going the "second mile" in all their efforts, going beyond basic needs assistance
                  to instill lasting positive change in the lives of those who they serve.
                  Their mission typically involves addressing the wide range of social and economic challenges plaguing vulnerable communities to improve the overall well-being of those
                  they work with.  I am proud of the work I've done with Second Mile Mission.

                <h2>Saint Francis Wolf Sanctuary</h2>
                <p>
                  Given my Corps of Cadets unit is named the "A-Company Wolfpack", it's fitting that we volunteer our time to supporting Saint Francis Wolf Sanctuary in their mission.
                  The Saint Francis Wolf Sanctuary is a non-profit organization dedicated to the rescue and care of captive-born wolves and wolfdogs. The sanctuary provides a safe environment
                  for rehabilitation of wolves and wolfdogs that have been bred and kept in captivity as pets, or are in need of a new home due to various circumstances.  In their new home,
                  rescued canines are provided with food, shelter, medical care, socialization, and enrichment.  In addition to rescue and rehabilitation, Saint Francis Wolf Sanctuary is committed to 
                  educating the public about wolves and advocate for their protection and conservation.
